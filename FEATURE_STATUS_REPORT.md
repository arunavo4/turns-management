## 📈 OVERALL PROJECT STATUS

**Completion: ~65%**

- Core infrastructure: 100% ✅
- Basic CRUD operations: 100% ✅
- User management: 100% ✅
- Business workflows: 20% ⚠️
- Advanced features: 0% ❌

The application has a solid foundation with all basic features working. The critical gap is in business workflow features (approvals, email notifications, stage management) which are essential for production use.

## 🔧 DATABASE NOTES

Many required tables and fields already exist in the schema:
- Approval fields in turns table
- Documents table
- Lock box history table
- Turn history table
- Utility providers tables

These just need UI implementation to be functional.
