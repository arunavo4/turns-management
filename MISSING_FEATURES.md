## Notes

### Vendor Module Justification
After reviewing the documentation, vendors ARE part of the planned system:
- Mentioned in PROJECT_PLAN.md (Week 9)
- Included in database schemas
- Required for turn assignments
- Part of the approval workflow
- Essential for work order management

### Simplified vs Full Workflow
Current implementation has 5 stages vs Odoo's 9. Consider:
- Is the simplified workflow sufficient?
- Do we need all intermediate stages?
- Can some stages be combined?
- User feedback needed for decision

### Local-First Priority
The architecture emphasizes local-first with Electric SQL. This should be prioritized over adding features to ensure:
- Instant performance (< 50ms response)
- Full offline capability
- Real-time sync across clients
- Reduced server costs
