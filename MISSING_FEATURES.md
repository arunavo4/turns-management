## üìù Implementation Notes

### Database Schema Status
Many required fields and tables already exist in the schema but lack UI implementation:
- ‚úÖ Approval fields in `turns` table
- ‚úÖ `documents` table for file management
- ‚úÖ `lock_box_history` table for security tracking
- ‚úÖ `turn_history` table for status tracking
- ‚úÖ `audit_logs` table for tracking changes
- ‚úÖ `utility_providers` and `property_utilities` tables
- ‚úÖ All date fields for turn lifecycle

### Missing Odoo Modules Not Yet Analyzed
- `property` module (base property management)
- `hide_action_archive_button` module
- `data_import_models` module
- Various theme modules (muk_web_*, artify_backend_theme, etc.)

### Technical Debt from Migration
- Mock data still in use for dashboard and turns
- Kanban board not persisting stage changes
- No real-time sync (was considering Electric SQL, now removed)
- React Query cache not optimized for complex workflows
- **Audit logging only implemented for Properties, missing for Vendors and Turns**

### Dependencies Needed
- **Email Service**: ‚úÖ **Resend** (decided) - for all email notifications
  - `npm install resend react-email @react-email/components`
- **File Storage**: S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Cloudinary for documents
- **PDF Generation**: react-pdf or puppeteer for reports
- **Excel Export**: exceljs or xlsx library
- **Rich Text Editor**: TipTap or Slate for scope of work editing
- **Calendar Component**: For scheduling and activity management
