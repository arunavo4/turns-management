- No real-time sync (was considering Electric SQL, now removed)
- React Query cache not optimized for complex workflows
- ‚úÖ **Fixed:** Better Auth session handling (using auth-helpers with proper getSession)
- ‚úÖ **Fixed:** Database insert issues (propertyId generation and nullable userId in audit logs)
- ‚úÖ **Fixed:** User profile/settings not showing real user data
- ‚úÖ **Fixed:** Navigation showing mock data instead of session data

### Dependencies Needed
- **Email Service**: ‚úÖ **Resend** (decided) - for all email notifications
  - `npm install resend react-email @react-email/components`
- **File Storage**: S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Cloudinary for documents
- **PDF Generation**: react-pdf or puppeteer for reports
- **Excel Export**: exceljs or xlsx library
- **Rich Text Editor**: TipTap or Slate for scope of work editing
- **Calendar Component**: For scheduling and activity management
